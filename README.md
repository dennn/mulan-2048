==========

This project will allow a web game to communicate with the server. It's very hacky at the moment and not clean at all. Use these references if you want to help:

- https://developer.chrome.com/apps/sockets_tcp#type-SocketProperties
- https://developer.chrome.com/apps/app_network

To start testing the app have Google chrome v33+ installed. Go to:

chrome://flags and turn on Experimental Extension APIs

Then go to chrome://extensions/ and select Developer Mode. Press Load Unpacked Extension and go to the directory. 

If the server is running you should see some communication when -debug-game is on.
